# 🥗 NutriCare Advisor (In Development)

NutriCare Advisor is a healthcare–nutrition advisory system currently **under active development**, aimed at recommending **safe food items for patients with multiple health conditions**.

The system focuses on identifying foods that are **commonly safe across all selected diseases**, helping avoid dietary conflicts that often arise in multi-disease cases.

NutriCare Advisor solves this by:

- Returning **Water as a default safe item** if no food matches all conditions
